                <p>Use the Flask and Flask-SQLAlchemy to create a portal for Treat Yo Self Salon. There are three classifications of users for the site: the Owner, Stylists and Patrons. The salon has one owner, multiple stylists, and multiple patrons.</p>
                <p>Stylists work Tuesday through Saturday, from 10am to 8p.</p>
                <p>Stylists only offer one service: a haircut. Each haircut takes 1 hour and starts on the hour.</p>
                <p>Patrons can make an appointment with any stylist. On a stylist&rsquo;s page, patrons can see available appointment time slots for the stylists. They can cancel appointments they have made.</p>

                <h2 id="Specifications">Specifications</h2>
                <p>These are the base requirements for making the web application. You can enhance.</p>

                        repository at that time will be considered your submission for this assignment.</li>
                    <li>You must be able to run your application by setting the <code>FLASK_APP</code> environment variable to your <code>salon.py</code> and running <code>flask run</code></li>
                    <li>You must be able to initialize your database by setting the <code>FLASK_APP</code> environment variable to your <code>salon.py</code> and running <code>flask initdb</code></li>
                    <li>Add a <code>requirements.txt</code> file containing the installed dependencies for your project. Make sure to add that file to source control.

                            <li>Run <code>pip freeze &gt; requirements.txt</code> from the root of your project with your <code>virtualenv</code> activated.</li>
                            <li>Be sure to use a <code>virtualenv</code> otherwise this list will get ridiculously long.</li>
                        </ul>

                <ul>
                    <li>You may find it handy to use the HTML <code>date</code> input type for appointment scheduling.</li>
                    <li>I recommend creating a development bootstrapping script that allows you to delete and recreate a database with an Owner, Stylists, and Patrons, with some appointments to make development and debugging easier.</li>
                    <li>While you are not going to be heavily graded on the style and design of your web site, it should be presented in a clear and readable manner.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2 id="Grading-Criteria">Grading Criteria</h2>
                <p>We will download a zip archive of the repo and run the <code>salon.py</code> Flask application via <code>flask run</code> in a terminal/console using a <code>virtualenv</code> with the dependencies from your <code>requirements.txt</code>                    installed in Python version 3.7.</p>
