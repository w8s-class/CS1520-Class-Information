                <p>Use the Flask and Flask-SQLAlchemy to create a portal for Treat Yo Self Salon. There are three classifications of users for the site: the Owner, Stylists and Patrons. The salon has one owner, multiple stylists, and multiple patrons.</p>
                <p>Stylists work Tuesday through Saturday, from 10am to 8p.</p>
                <p>Stylists only offer one service: a haircut. Each haircut takes 1 hour and starts on the hour.</p>
                <p>Patrons can make an appointment with any stylist. On a stylist&rsquo;s page, patrons can see available appointment time slots for the stylists. They can cancel appointments they have made.</p>

                <h2 id="Specifications">Specifications</h2>
                <p>These are the base requirements for making the web application. You can enhance.</p>

                </ul>

                <h3 id="Additional-Notes%2FHints">Additional Notes/Hints</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Since we covered Flask already, I highly recommend setting up some dummy routes you will need that will, at the very least, return "Hello World" to make sure you can get Flask working.</li>
                    <li>You may find it handy to use the HTML <code>date</code> input type for appointment scheduling.</li>
                    <li>I recommend creating a development bootstrapping Flask cli command that allows you to delete and recreate a database with an Owner, Stylists, and Patrons, with some appointments to make development and debugging easier.
                        <ul>
                            <li>Consider using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html" target="_blank"><code>datetime.datetime.now()</code></a> for appointment time generation so you don't have to worry about resetting appointment times for the as time passes.</li>
                            <li>Also, <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#timedelta-objects" target="_blank"><code>timedelta</code></a> provides a way to simply perform math on dates.
                                <ul>
                                    <li><em>In addition to the operations listed above timedelta objects support certain additions and subtractions with date and datetime objects.</em></li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Model relationships are <strong>your friend</strong>!!! Use them to tie the patrons and stylist together through appointments.
                        <ul>
                            <li>I recommend creating another object to handle the appointments that contain pointers to the datetime, stylist, and patron.</li>
                            <li>SQLAlchemy query filters can be used to get the exact data you need.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Get familiar with using <code>GET</code> and <code>POST</code> in your routes to handle object creation and persistence.</li>
                    <li>Use a SQL visualization tool to help inspect the database. Many IDEs include built-in SQLite tools (VS Code, PyCharm, etc.)</li>
                    <li>Since we do not use a textbook, use the documentation links to dig into the features you will need to use. If an approach feels to complicated/complex for what you are trying to do, it probably is.</li>
                    <li>While you are not going to be heavily graded on the style and design of your web site, it should be presented in a clear and readable manner.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2 id="Grading-Criteria">Grading Criteria</h2>
                <p>We will download a zip archive of the repo and run the <code>salon.py</code> Flask application via <code>flask run</code> in a terminal/console using a <code>virtualenv</code> with the dependencies from your <code>requirements.txt</code>                    installed in Python version 3.7.</p>
